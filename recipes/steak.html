    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bone-in rib eye steaks are simply basted with butter, garlic, rosemary,
      and thyme while they cook in a cast-iron skillet, infusing them with
      full-bodied flavor.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (1 1/4lb) bone-in rib eye steaks</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly ground pepper.
        Let the meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the canola oil until shimmering. Add
        the steaks and cook over high heat until crusty on the bottom, about 5
        minutes. Turn the steaks and add the butter, thyme, garlic, and rosemary
        to the skillet. Cook over high heat, basting the steaks with the melted
        butter, garlic, and herbs, until the steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7
        minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the steaks to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut
        the steaks off the bone, then slice the meat across the grain and serve.
